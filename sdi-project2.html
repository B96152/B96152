<p>I will go surf.</p>
<p>I will choose what surfboard to take (long board for little to no waves, or short board for big to 200' waves), whether or not to wear a wetsuit, and to wear sunscreen or not.</p>
<p>I will drive down to the Gulf of Mexico whether or not there are waves. If there are waves I will take my short board, if there are not any waves I will take my long board</p>
